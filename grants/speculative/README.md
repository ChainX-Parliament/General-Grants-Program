## :clipboard: About 
ChainX has been fully open sourced. As part of promoting ChainX’s ecosystem. ChainX Council will provide a comprehensive subsidy plan, mainly for software development, community development and market expansion. 

## :bookmark_tabs: Grant Amount
Technical direction:

* Those with a budget of less than 10,000 USDT will pass the review as soon as possible.
* Those with a budget of more than 10,000 USDT and less than 50,000 USDT will require longer review time.
* The team can apply for grants multiple times, but they need to complete the previous project (to be consistent with the description in the application) to get the next grant. We are mainly interested in projects that can be completed within 3 months.

Market direction:

* Each applicant can support within 10,000 US dollars.

Community grants:

* Each applicant can get a grant within $5,000

Others:

* If you have a good idea and planed the budget you need, and boldly submit an application, we are willing to communicate with you!

### Licensing
In order to successfully receive grant funding for your application it is necessary for the project to have **open source** code. We prefer Apache 2.0 but the GNU GPL v3 license is also acceptable.

### Documentation
To ensure ease-of-use we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use the product.

## :pencil: Process
If you are considering applying for a grant, please follow the process below.
  
 
1. **Application**

    We recommend checking out the [technical grant template](https://github.com/ChainX-Parliament/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant_application_template.md). It gives an indication of what a good roadmap should look like, plus it outlines the criteria of what we look for in an application.
       
    1. Fill out the Google form for your grant application by clicking the following link: [:arrow_right: Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Immh_3_6ZQa6FiqqiH_oEII2abPT6HGLM_wX4BLbRE8/)
    
        Partially public applications that limit financial information (e.g. funding amount requested) to the Google form are preferred. However, teams are free to make fully public applications as well as fully private applications. 
        
        Teams that chose to make a fully private application are done once this form is complete. Teams that have chosen to make a fully or partially public application should proceed to the next step.
       
    1. Fully or partially public applications should be made via a pull request to this repo by following the steps below.
       1. Fork this repository.
       1. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the [technical grant template](https://github.com/ChainX-Parliament/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant_application_template.md).
           * Most applications should go into the [speculative](https://github.com/ChainX-Parliament/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/grants/speculative) sub-folder.
           * In the few cases where the application is a response to specific RFP then the application should go into the [rfps](https://github.com/ChainX-Parliament/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/grants/rfps) sub-folder.
       1. Label the file as "project_name.md".
       1. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
       1. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
       1. The body of the pull request will show a template that requests an abstract of the project and the completion of a checklist. Please complete as appropriate and take care to include all necessary information. The **pull request template** can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ChainX-Parliament/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
       
1. **Review**
   * The ChainX-Parliament will review the applications received, determine if more information is required and potentially schedule a call with the team.
   * Parity Technologies may also assist in the review of some applications.
   
1. **Decision**
   * The ChainX-Parliament will notify the applicants of whether their proposal has been accepted for grant funding or not.
   * If a team is successful, further communication will be required to determine specific details around timelines and payment schedules.
   
1. **Follow up**
   * Once progress has started, the ChainX-Parliament will want to have follow up conversations to see how the project is progressing.
   * To help to speed up the milestone evaluation process, take a look at the [Milestone Deliverables Guidelines](./grants/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md)

### Who we are interested in funding

* Individuals
  * Developers, anyone in the community
  * Note: all contracts need to be signed with legal entities (e.g. an LLC / Ltd).

## :mailbox_with_mail: RFP Suggestion
If you think that we should sponsor the development of certain tools/projects related to **ChainX** that aren't in the [ChainX Stack](./grants/chainx_stack.md) then feel free to submit an RFP suggestion using the process described below. We're particularly interested in supporting projects that could be leveraged by other builders in our ecosystem. We will review your proposal and if we believe it’s useful, we will create an RFP based on your idea and try to find teams to work on it.

Instructions for submitting an RFP suggestion:

1. Fork this repository.
1. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the [suggestion template](./rfp-proposal/suggestion-template.md).
1. Label the file as "*project_name*.md" where *project_name* is the name of your project.
1. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
1. Once you have completed the application, click on "create new pull request".
